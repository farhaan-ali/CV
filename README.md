## Who am I? 

I'm a proactive, energetic, and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a role where I can continue to challenge myself and extend my programming knowledge 
whilst working on products and services that bring value to society. 

I started my career in the not-for-profit sector working in various operational and management roles. I got to travel to over 40 countries, lead and manage people and projects. I wanted a different challenge that involved more of a technical skillset hence I started a Master's Degree in Business Analytics (think applied data science) where I became more passionate about engineering vs just analytics and machine learning. It was during my data engineering course where we had to train and deploy a machine learning models as part of a data pipeline where my interest in engineering got sparked. I always believed you needed a Computer Science degree to become a programmer. After some research, it became apparent that this isn't the case, fast-forward a few months in which I decided to commit to software engineering as a career route by attending the Bootcamp.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

As the youngest Country Manager for my previous company, I had to learn new hard and soft skills quickly from delivering management accounts to the board of directors or learning how to communicate to a multicultural team made up of 20+ nationalities.

I love to challenge myself, recently for my final project of the Bootcamp I had to learn a new programming language (my first strongly typed language) and deliver a final product within two weeks with tested and clean code. 

#### Leadership and Teamwork

I am naturally inclined to take on the responsibility to make sure we reach our objectives. Recently in our group project, I would volunteer to run the initial planning phase of the project (with the group's permission) to give our project a kickstart.

In my previous job, I was responsible for directly leading 11 employees to reach our goals, which involved me introducing new management practices I adopted from the agile methodology such as daily stand-ups. 

#### Effective Communication

I have presented my previous organisations 5-year plan at the global conference speaking in front of over 1000 delegates simplifying complex concepts to ensure the audience understands the key concepts to take forward.
